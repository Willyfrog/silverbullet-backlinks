# SilverBullet plug for Backlinks

Provides access to pages that link to the one currently being edited.

## Wait, SilverBullet?

If you don't know what it is, check its [webpage](https://silverbullet.md), but if
you want me to spoil the fun: it is an extensible note taking app with markdown and plain files at its core
(well... there is a bit of magic in there too, but what good it would be without a little magic?)

## Installation

Open (`cmd+k`) your `PLUGS` note in SilverBullet and add this plug to the list:

```yaml
- https://github.com/Willyfrog/silverbullet-backlinks/releases/download/v0.3/backlinks.plug.json
```

Then run the `Plugs: Update` command and off you go!
