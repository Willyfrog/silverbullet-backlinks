# SilverBullet plug for Backlinks
Provides access to pages that link to the one currently being edited.

## Wait, silverbullet?
If you don't know what it is, check its [webpage](https://silverbullet.md), but if
you want me to spoil the fun it is an extensible note taking app with markdown and plain files at is core
(well... there is a bit of magic in there too, but what good it be without a little magic?)
## Installation
Open your `PLUGS` note in SilverBullet and add this plug to the list:

```yaml
- github:willyfrog/silverbullet-backlinks/github.plug.json
```

Then run the `Plugs: Update` command and off you go!
