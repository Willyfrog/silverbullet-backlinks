# SilverBullet plug for Backlinks

Provides access to pages that link to the one currently being edited.

**UPDATE:** Backlinks functionality is [now built into Silverbullet](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet/blob/main/website/CHANGELOG.md#050).

## Wait, SilverBullet?

If you don't know what it is, check its [webpage](https://silverbullet.md), but if
you want me to spoil the fun: it is an extensible note taking app with markdown and plain files at its core
(well... there is a bit of magic in there too, but what good it would be without a little magic?)
